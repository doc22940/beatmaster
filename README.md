# Beat Master

t.b.d. what exactly this is going to be.. :)

## Running/developing Beat Master

First of all, make sure you have NodeJS v8.x (or higher) installed and npm v5.x (or higher).

Next, put a BeatSaber custom song .zip file named `song.zip` in the `data` folder. You can get song .zip files from [Beat Saver](https://beatsaver.com/).

Then:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run-script dev`

Then open up your browser at http://localhost:1234
